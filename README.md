Hi, I'm Shruti. I have completed the Frontend assignment given by DevDynamics. This project is a simple dashboard that visualizes organization developers' activity data throughout the day for a week's time.

# Getting Started with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
